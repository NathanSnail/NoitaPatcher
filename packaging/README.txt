    Hamis/

These are example projects that use NoitaPatcher functionality.

    server: A simple TCP server supporting one way sync between two clients.

    nsew_client: A Noita mod that communicates with the server program. By
    default the mod writes world data. To receive world data you have to launch
    with the environment variable `ROLE=R` set.

    rainbow_cursor: Mod that changes the world under your cursor to rainbow
    colors.

    Hamis: Mod using NoitaPatcher to make a Hamis entity into the player.

To run the example mods you have to put the NoitaPatcher/ folder into your
Noita mods/ folder. When developing a mod you would usually put NoitaPatcher/
inside the mod as an included dependency.
